A Hoenn Pokédex web-app + API!

After my issues navigating the PokéApi - It's great, but hardly beginner-friendly, and I have to assume needlessly in-depth for a lot of users - I've decided to have a go at my own one. It's MUCH smaller in size, and only extends to the first 386 Pokémon. I've included the Node script I used to extract and assemble the data from the PokéApi, so anyone can pretty much replicate this. 

The data is pretty much directly from the PokéApi, although I did a bunch of cleaning up and formatting, and removed certain later-Gen pokémon from evolution chains.
