A pok√©dex web app!

This uses the pok√©api - cheers to everyone who's contributed to that, making this would be impossible without it!

It's basically a list of the 386 pokemon from Gen I to III, with some fun info displayed when you select one.

It's available at http://bk-pokedex.netflify.app.

It hopefully goes without saying that all of the credit for the designs of the pok√©mon, the pok√©ball etc lie with their creators, presumably people at Nintendo - not me at any rate. 

This should be more or less responsive across most screen sizes! If you're into splitting your monitor horizontally with two super wide short windows you might have a bad time though üòÇ

Hopefully I'll add some other fun stuff like a search bar soon - I'd also like to condense the stuff I use from the pokeapi down and maybe create my own much lighter api from that information, which will hopefully make the app work faster and more consistently
