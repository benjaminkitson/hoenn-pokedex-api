A pokédex web app!

This uses the pokéapi - cheers to everyone who's contributed to that, making this would be impossible without it!

It's basically a list of the 386 pokemon from Gen I to III, with some fun info displayed when you select one.

It's available at http://bk-pokedex.netflify.app.

It hopefully goes without saying that all of the credit for the designs of the pokémon, the pokéball etc lie with their creators, presumably people at Nintendo - not me at any rate. 

This previously only worked on desktop - the opposite is now true, it now only works on mobile, desktop functionality should be restored soon!
